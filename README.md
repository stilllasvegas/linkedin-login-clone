Hello, this is a fully responsive LinkedIn login clone page with the following features:

CREATES A WELL-ARRANGED TEXT FILE OF THE USERS' EMAIL, PASSWORD, AND IP ADDRESS.
Backend php written for complete extraction of data.
Complete style.css added.
Fully responsive to all screen sizes.
Just add this to a link, and get user's email and password in return.
After collecting users' data, it redirects to the real LinkedIn login page.
Have fun.
